This repository contains the code used to generate the data presented in the Manuscript "Neural Kernels for Recursive Support Vector Regression as a
  Model for Episodic Memory".
  
a) all python scripts starting with "main" invoke the core routines in different problem settings (a video data example, an audio data example, low pass noise).

b) the video and audio examples used are also part of this repository (see additional license statement).

c) the yml file contains a list of used python modules
